# SIH_2024

Welcome to SIH_2024!

I'm excited you want to contribute! Before jumping in, check out the rules to keep things smooth and enjoyable. Let’s make this project awesome together!

## Contribution Guidelines

1. **No Zombies Allowed**: Ensure that your code doesn’t bring the project back from the dead. If it's buggy, it’s best left alone!

2. **Comments Are Like Sprinkles**: Use comments generously to make your code sweet and understandable. Just don’t overdo it—too many sprinkles can ruin the cake.

3. **Fork & Feature**: Always fork the repo and create a feature branch before adding new features. No one likes a surprise change in the main branch!

4. **Commit Messages: No Cryptic Codes**: Write commit messages like you’re telling a story to a five-year-old. Make it clear and avoid jargon.

5. **Merge Conflicts Are Like Pizza Toppings**: The more toppings (conflicts) you have, the more effort it takes to make everything blend well. Resolve conflicts with care!

6. **Documentation Is Your BFF**: Document your code like it’s a love letter to your future self. It will thank you later.

7. **Code Reviews: Not a Roast Session**: Give feedback constructively. We’re here to improve, not to roast someone’s code like a marshmallow.

8. **Testing: More Than Just a Suggestion**: Test your changes like you're testing a new recipe. Make sure it's delicious (or bug-free) before serving!

Thanks for contributing and happy coding!
